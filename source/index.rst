Lay of the land
===========================================

The distinction between `reconnaissance <https://tymyrddin.github.io/red-recon/>`_ and initial enumeration is an
arbitrary grey area, and during enumeration new hosts and/or services may show up, so what you can not find
here you may find `there <https://tymyrddin.github.io/red-recon/>`_.
