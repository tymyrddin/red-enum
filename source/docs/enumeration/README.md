# Introduction

## What?

Enumeration is a process of connecting to and interrogating a network or system to retrieve information about that 
network or system. Take information already gathered during reconnaissance (like IP addresses) and during scanning 
(open ports) and gather as much data about the targets and services running on the targets, using a variety of 
techniques and tools. 

## Why?

Move further and deeper into the scanning process to include security scanning. Enumeration is particularly successful 
in networks that contain unprotected network resources and services.

## How?

* [Host enumeration](host.md)
* [macOS enumeration](macos.md)
* [Linux enumeration](linux.md)
* [Windows enumeration](windows.md)
