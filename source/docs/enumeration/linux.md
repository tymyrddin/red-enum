## Tools

* [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) is a basic shell script that performs over 65 checks, getting anything from kernel information to locating possible escalation points such as potentially useful SUID/GUID files and Sudo/rhost mis-configurations and more.
* [enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/) is a linux alternative to enum.exe for enumerating data from Windows and Samba hosts. It is a wrapper around the Samba tools smbclient, rpclient, net and nmblookup 
* [Netcat](https://sectools.org/tool/netcat/) is network debugging and investigation tool that can assist with port scanning, transferring files, and port listening, and it can also be used as a backdoor. 
* [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/)
