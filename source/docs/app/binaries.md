# Download or obtain and decompile binaries

Download or obtain binaries and then use a decompiler to [analyse the binary](red-reverse:index). Review the application in a debugger. Look for information such as remote systems the application connects to, database connection strings, or usernames and passwords used by the application (there may be a backdoor).
