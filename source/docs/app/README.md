# Introduction

## What?

Application scanning tools can be used to perform an audit on an application. There are basically two types of application audit tools:

* A dynamic analysis tool assesses vulnerabilities in an application by analysing the behaviour of the application while it is running (how it responds to input). The best is a combination of scanning and using scanners like Zap and Burp in a manual walkthrough.
* In a static analysis, the source code is reviewed for vulnerabilities. Can be done manually or using a static code analysis tool.

Use both for manual and automated scanning of the application.

## Why?

Move further and deeper into the scanning process to include security scanning and discover [vulnerabilities to exploit](red-app:index).

* [Download or obtain and decompile binaries](binaries.md)
